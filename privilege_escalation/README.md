# Privilege Escalation 🔐

## What is Privilege Escalation?

Privilege escalation is a technique where an attacker or user gains higher-level permissions than originally granted. It allows unauthorized access to resources, system functions, or data that should be restricted to users with elevated privileges (like administrators or root users). 🚀

## Why is it Important? 🎯

- **Security Awareness** 🛡️: Understanding privilege escalation helps developers and system administrators identify and fix vulnerabilities
- **System Protection** 🔒: Prevents unauthorized users from gaining admin/root access
- **Data Integrity** 📊: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized modification or exposure
- **Compliance** ✅: Meeting security standards and regulations
- **Risk Mitigation** ⚠️: Reduces attack surface and potential damage from compromised accounts

## Types 🔀

- **Vertical Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges (user → admin)
- **Horizontal Escalation**: Accessing resources of other users at same privilege level
- **Post-Exploitation Actions** (as root/admin):
  - Install backdoors or persistence mechanisms
  - Extract sensitive data and credentials
  - Modify system configurations and security settings
  - Create hidden user accounts
  - Access protected files and databases
  - Manipulate logs to cover tracks
  - Deploy malware or ransomware
  - Pivot to other systems on the network
